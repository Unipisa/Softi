# Softi Workbench

### This is the workbench for the acquisition of *the code developed for the CEP by Tonina Starita in 1968, to smoothen a curve.* (The bit in italic should be the value of a script variable $SC_description). 

It comes with a few predefined folders, to support the users in the process. *What follows has to be checked.*

Folder [raw materials](./raw_material) is for the original materials, as they have been found or submitted.

Folder [browsable source](./browsable_source) folder is for a browsable version of the source code, if not already accessible with current tools in the previous folder, e.g., because they are zipped.

Folder [source](./source) is for a curated source code version, in the format required by the [DT2SG](https://github.com/Unipisa/DIUNIPI-SWH-SSGC) tool to build the development history as a git repository.

The files in [metadata](/.metadata) shall be as described in the [SWHAP-PISA](https://github.com/Unipisa/SWHAP-DT2SG) guidelines.
