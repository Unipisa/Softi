# Softi Workbench

### This is the workbench for the acquisition of "the code developed for the CEP by Tonina Starita in 1968, to smoothen a curve." (The bit in quotes should be the value of a script/bash variable $SC_description; bits in italic in the following are working comments). 

Any SWHAP-Pisa workbench comes with a few predefined folders, to support the users in the process. *What follows has to be checked.*

Folder [raw materials](./raw_material) is for the original materials, as they have been found or submitted.

Folder [browsable source](./browsable_source) is for a browsable version of the source code, if not already accessible with current tools in the previous folder, e.g., because they are zipped.

Folder [source](./source) is for a curated revision of the source code, in the format required by the [DT2SG](https://github.com/Unipisa/DIUNIPI-SWH-SSGC) tool to build the development history as a git repository, automatically in a bash environment. *Does it depends on some file in metadata?*

The files in [metadata](/.metadata) shall be as described in the [SWHAP-PISA](https://github.com/Unipisa/SWHAP-DT2SG) guidelines.
